        "text": " As  Christians we have been created for good works ,but more often than not we fall below the standard.Paul dealt with the same issue among the Galatian Christians. He guides them on how to become fruit -bearing Christians .Let us see how we as Christians in our contemporary society can keep in step with the spirit and thereby become fruit-bearing Christian \n Galatians 5:1-6 \n 1. (a.) According to VS 4 how is it possible to fall away from the grace? \n (b) In this regard what advice does Paul give in verse 1(b) \n (C)From what have the Galatians been set free and for what reasons?  \n 2.Why will Christ be of no value  to those who follow the law? 3.Paul says that the only thing that counts is Faith expressing itself through love.What things in our life do we exalt above the fact of our salvation and how would Paul's teaching help us? THE DANGER. Galatians 5:7-15 4.Who and/or what is Paul warning the Galatians against? 5.watch out or you will be destroyed by each other \n verse 15.What do you understand by this statement ? What remedy does Paul give? 6.In what ways are people or groups of people acting as agitators,or using false persuasions to divert believers from the course of Christ?
